## Friends TV Show Trivia Game
Trivia game based on the Friends TV Show with 20 trivia questions with a 15 second timer
## Motivation
I wanted to create a trivia game for Friends fans with a list of 20 question and a 15 second timer. I wanted the trivia to reward correct answers with a funny Friends giphy. I wanted to create a difficult trivia game but at the same time have it be rewarding.
